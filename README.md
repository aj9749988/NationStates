Please note - The script is currently under development; the current version autoselects the first choice for each issue and then opens any packs earned. I am working on a version that tests all the choices within the issues to determine if any packs have higher pack success rates. Also, this hack was created for educational purposes, not intended to be exploited in-game. Enjoy! :)
